## Lessons Learned

Aside from technical knowledge, I learned that it is difficult to create a perfect project plan that outlines all the tasks I need to accomplish. Problems might arise at any time, and sometimes I realize that I was heading in the wrong direction. It is, nevertheless, what makes programming interesting. The more tasks I complete, the more problems I solve, the more valuable experience I gain, the better the project.
